    <h4>Our Philosophy</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <p class="card-text">The LADY LIGHTNING GOLD has “A Commitment To Excellence”.</p> 

    <p>The LADY LIGHTNING Softball program stands for developing the softball skills necessary for young women to compete at the highest level of softball competition.   Players who work hard at developing their skills both physically and mentally will have a sense of satisfaction at the end of the season, not only individually, but also as a team.</p>   

        <p>The attainment of exceptional athletic skills or the winning of games is secondary to encouraging and developing the qualities of honesty, loyalty, commitment, discipline, responsibility, team work, respect for others, good sportsmanship, and academic excellence.</p>  

    <p>In our program, we attempt to make each player conscious of how meaningful her specific role is to the total team effort.</p>   

    <p>In the LADY LIGHTNING GOLD Fast Pitch Softball Organization, we teach an accelerated level of softball so that our young ladies will be prepared to play at the collegiate level. We have qualified coaches on our staff that not only teach a high level of softball, but also teach the young ladies about life. </p>  

        <p>Tournament play is essential in our organization. We work hard at scheduling a series of highly competitive and exposure tournaments throughout the year. We research and put together tournament schedules that consist of the top exposure tournaments for our team. This is done in order for them to have as many opportunities to play at a college that best suits them for not only their athletic skills but also academically as well. We search out and find the highest level of competitive tournaments for our team in order to keep that competitive drive and spirit that keeps them excited and at the top of their game. We also play in exposure tournaments that give them the maximum amount of exposure possible for colleges to see and recruit them from all parts of the nation.</p>   

    <p>Our primary goal is "Devotion to our team and players in order to teach the young ladies lessons in life as well as softball. We also want to help them build friendships and relationships that will last a life time. We hope and pray that their love for Fast Pitch Softball will continue to grow through their experience with the Lady Lightning Organization and the people that make it all possible.</p>
